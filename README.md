This addon creates notes based on concept maps that are written in Xmind 8. 
(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map</a> 
for an explanation of concept maps) It uses the relationships in the concept 
maps as questions, concepts following relationships are considered Answers to 
these questions. Prior relationships and concepts are displayed in a reference 
on top of the cards created by this addon

You can synchronize your anki notes with the concept map by importing the 
concept map again.

I will post a github link to this project in the near future, for questions: 
email me: l.loos95@gmail.com

Example: This concept map leads to the creation of the following cards:
