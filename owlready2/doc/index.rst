Welcome to Owlready2's documentation!
*************************************

Owlready2 is a package for ontology-oriented programming in Python. It can load OWL 2.0 ontologies
as Python objects, modify them, save them, and perform reasoning via HermiT
(included). Owlready2 allows a transparent access to OWL ontologies (contrary
to usual Java-based API).

Owlready version 2 includes an optimized triplestore / quadstore, based on SQLite3.
This quadstore is optimized both for performance and memory consumption. Contrary to version 1,
Owlready2 can deal with big ontologies. Owlready2 can also access to UMLS and medical terminology
(using the integrated PyMedTermino2 submodule).

Owlready2 has been created at the LIMICS reseach lab,
University Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cit√©, INSERM UMRS 1142, Paris 6 University, by
Jean-Baptiste Lamy. It was initially developed during the VIIIP research project funded by ANSM,
the French Drug Agency;
this is why some examples in this documentation relate to drug ;).

Owlready2 is available under the GNU LGPL licence v3.
